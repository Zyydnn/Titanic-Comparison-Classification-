# Titanic-Comparison-Classification-
This project explores the application of two popular machine learning methods, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, for classification tasks on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict passenger survival based on various features, such as age, fare, class, and other demographics. By comparing these methods, we aim to determine which model performs better and understand the strengths and limitations of each in this context.

# Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is a well-known benchmark in data science, containing data on passengers who traveled on the RMS Titanic. This project involves:
* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
* Modeling: Implementing Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models for binary classification (survived/did not survive).
* Model Comparison: Evaluating and comparing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, 
* Analysis and Conclusion: Analyzing the results to conclude which model provides better predictive accuracy and general insights into feature importance.

# Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting methods. With the use of visualizations and statistical metrics, the project highlighted key insights into the performance and effectiveness of the models.
